                He, the incarnation of hope was imprisoned for greed. Shackled beneath the clock of a cyclical sun wading through his barred 
                window. As a little robin gazes upon unseen death and a spilt pitcher. He, the incarnation of hope is forsaken by the 
                corrosion of the mind. Lonley, he often realizes that death is the greatest lover of life. Does that mean death will love 
                him too? Deeply steal his heart and make it skip a beat. Is love death itself? Fulfilling a biological purpose of finding 
                a mate, these confused wounds of expectation, of surrender to the will within. It's all an affair with death, seeking 
                serenity we all know is the eternal silence beneath the stars her hand in yours. Empty lonely nights are restless and 
                alive, but beside you they reach down to sleep beside us. No, these are fictions of a crushed mind, what am I to delineate 
                the cursed parasite of life and soul and the flirtatious mercy of death...
